A thread is a thread of execution in a program. The JavaVirtual Machine allows an application to have 
multiple threads of execution running concurrently.
 "Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority areexecuted in preference to threads with
lower priority. Each threadmay or may not also be marked as a daemon. When code running insome thread
creates a new Thread object, the newthread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of thecreating
thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if thecreating thread is a daemon.
