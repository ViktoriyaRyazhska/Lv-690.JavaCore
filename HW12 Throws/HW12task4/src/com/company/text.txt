ello, my name is Artem. I was born 12.11.1999 in Ukraine. Like many other children I went to a kindergarten. At the
age of 6 I went to school. My school was next to my house. Many pupils of our primary school were my neighbours. I was
very proud when I became a pupil. But very soon I realized that this was not a game, and I had to work hard if I wanted
my parents to be pleased with me. Now, when the school years have passed so quickly I see clearly that sometimes I
succeeded and sometimes I failed in my intention.
I am an outgoing person. I think I took after my father. As a matter of fact my parents are friendly and hospitable.
They like to invite our friends and neighbours.
I like to go to discos, to parties with my friends. We like to dance, have coffee and soft drinks. I like when somebody
plays the guitar or the piano. But I myself don’t play any musical instrument. Certainly we talk a lot about life, our
problems. But now I can’t afford to spend much time for entertainment.
