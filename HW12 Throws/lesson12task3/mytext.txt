Java Thread pool represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the job and reuse many times.
In case of thread pool, a group of fixed size threads are created. A thread from the thread pool is
pulled out and assigned a job by the service provider. After completion of the job, thread is
contained in the thread pool again.
The language derives much of its Syntax from C and C++ but has a simpler object model and fewer low-level
facilities. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode which can run on any Java virtual machine
(JVM) regardless of computer architecture.
The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were developed
by Sun from 1995. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process,
Sun made available most of their Java technologies as Virtual Machine under the GNU General Public License.
Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler
for Java and var GNU Classpath.
Java's design, industry backing and portability have made Java one of the fastest-growing and most widely
used programming languages in the modern computing industry.
