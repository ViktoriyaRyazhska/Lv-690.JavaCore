There are plenty of different professions.
Some of my friends want to be doctors, others want to be lawyers or journalists, some want to become designers, IT workers.
 But I’ve always had a particular interest to advertising.
 So, I‘ve already decided what I want to do, when I grow up.
 I want to have a job where I can apply my creative skills.
 I‘d like to have a job of a creative director in an advertising agency.
 If you want to be a good art director, you need to be creative.
 The way advertisement motivates people to do something what they actually didn’t plan to do is fascinating.
 I also strongly believe that work of creative director can be compared with art.
 A good advertisement is really an art object.
